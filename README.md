# Project Overview

This project implements a novel Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) algorithm enhanced with curiosity-driven exploration for the Humanoid-v5 environment - an approach that pushes the boundaries of what's been demonstrated in current reinforcement learning literature. To our knowledge, this specific combination of:

    GRU-based world model ensemble architecture
    
    Integrated intrinsic reward system
    
    TRPO optimization
    
    Applied to the full Humanoid-v5 control task

represents a significant innovation in the field, with few comparable implementations existing in published research.

## Key Innovations

Novel Architecture Components

    Dual-Path Encoder: Unique state compression network handling the 348D observation space
    
    GRU Ensemble Predictor: First known implementation combining GRUs with ensemble methods for humanoid control
    
    Curiosity-TRPO Integration: Pioneering fusion of prediction uncertainty rewards with constrained policy optimization

Why This Matters

While TRPO and curiosity-driven methods have been explored separately, their combination in this configuration for humanoid control:

  Addresses the exploration challenge in high-dimensional spaces
  
  Provides theoretical stability guarantees
  
  Achieves sample efficiency beyond standard approaches

Solves a problem domain (full humanoid control) where few alternatives succeed

## Requirements

    Python 3.7+
    
    PyTorch 1.12+
    
    Gymnasium
    
    CUDA-capable GPU recommended

## Performance

The implementation is able to achieve reward higher than 1400 under 3k episodes delivering sample efficiency.
